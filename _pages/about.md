I'm currently a Research Fellow at [IIT, Jodhpur](https://iitj.ac.in/). I've previously worked as an intern at the [VCAI](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/visual-computing-and-artificial-intelligence) lab in [MPI](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home), Saarland, where I explored learning based Cloth Simulation to improve speed and accuracy. I've finished my Master's from [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) center at IIIT, Hyderabad, under the guidance of [Dr.Avinash Sharma](https://sites.google.com/site/asharmaresearch/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Deep Learning and Geometric Processing. I'm also interested in Neural Garment Simulation, and clothed human modeling.

I've previously worked on 3D garment digitization and retargetting, UV parametrization, automated terrain generation, point cloud upsampling, scene understanding and object detection and tracking in $$360^{\circ}$$ videos. I've completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [KLE Technological University](https://www.kletech.ac.in/) guided by [Uma Mudengudi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=xBaqwmkAAAAJ&hl=en).

I indulge myself in books, sketching and painting in my free time :)
